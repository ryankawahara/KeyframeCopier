# KeyframeCopier

A node-based tool that allows the user to copy keyed attributes from one object to one or more other objects. The tool will detect user-defined attributes as well and gives the user the option to invert copied channels as well. Relies on the [nodegraph library](https://github.com/ryankawahara/nodegraph-pyqt).
